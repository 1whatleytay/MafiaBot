Here are some commands you might find helpful.
```
Setting Up
    [setup]
        Creates the "Mafia" category and creates its channels.
        You NEED to do this before anything else, or else the bot will yell at you. No one wants that.

Starting a Game
    [create]
        Creates a game lobby that people can join. Run this first!
    [join]
        After a lobby is created, people can join with this command.
    [start]
        Starts the game. Be sure to create a lobby first.
    [reset]
        Gets rid of the last lobby or game, zero, nada, zut.
        You might need to run this before you can create another lobby with [create].

Selecting People
    [vote] <number>
        Use this to vote people out.
        If you're mafia, you'll use this to chose who you want to kill.
        If you're town, you'll use it to vote people out during the day.
    [select] <number>
        The bot will ask you to use this in dms.
        Select the person you want to perform your action on (heal, investigate, etc).
```
Each command should start with a `-`. For example, send `-start` or `-vote 4`.

Good luck!
