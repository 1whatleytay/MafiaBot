Detective time! Once a night, you can act like a peeping tom and check the suspiciousness of somebody in the town. If they're a mafia member, you'll be told that they're "suspiscious", and "normal" otherwise. You can use this information to your advantage among the other townspeople when voting the next day. Watch out though, as the mafia probably have you on priority queue for being offed in the night, once they figure out who you are. Sleep tight.
