No talking! During nighttime, you can choose a person to "silence" - they won't be able to talk in the chat during the next day, but will remain alive. Man, laxatives and sleeping pills sure work wonders. Use 'em for good or evil. You're still technically win with town, so try not to be a douche (or be one, I don't really care).
