Time to put those medical skills to use! Every night, you have the option of 'saving' somebody via the power of medicine and drugs. It will make them invulnerable if they're attacked by the mafia. However, you can only heal yourself twice in a row (so don't be a selfish coward). Just don't let the mafia find you - or else you'll probably die pretty quick.
