Time to get a bit bloody. Every night, you and and any other of your foul kind get to collectively pick somebody to kill, for reasons unbeknownst to us peasants. If you kill everyone else, you win, sicko.
Detectives can easily root you out, especially as the game goes on and the town shrinks, so watch out. Oh, and no - you can't kill yourselves (I've already tried).
